### Forking the Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

* Log into GitHub or create an account.
* Locate the GitHub Repository.
* At the top of the repository, on the right side of the page, select "Fork"
* You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Creating a Clone

How to run this project locally:

* Install the GitPod Browser Extension for Chrome.
* After installation, restart the browser.
* Log into GitHub or create an account.
* Locate the GitHub Repository.
* Click the green "GitPod" button in the top right corner of the repository. This will trigger a new gitPod workspace to be created from the code in github where you can work locally.
